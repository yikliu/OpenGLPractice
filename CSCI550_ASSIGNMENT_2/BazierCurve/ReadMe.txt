========================================================================

This is submission to CSCI550 project 2: Bezier Curve Drawing and Polygon Mesh.

Define vertex and draw polyline and besier curve.
    The application is initialized to show a green line bounded rectangle as drawing area.
	clicking at least three times inside the green box will define and draw a line strip. Each
	clicked vertex will added to the line strip. Using this line as control polyline, a besier curve 
	will be generated by level-4 approximation. 
	
3D polygon mesh and automatic rotation
	A 3D polygon mesh based on the drawn curve will be rendered when switched to 3D mode. 
	The generated mesh rotates continuously. Users can switch between 2D and 3D mode by pressing
	"s". Users can also select which axis the rotation is about. Axises are also drawn with color: X-Axis (Yellow), 
	Y-Axis(Cyan), 	Z-Axis (Red). Also drawn is the green box indicating drawing boudary. 

Menus: Right click will invoke the pop-up menu, it has four submenus
	1. Rubberbanding: turning rubberbanding on/off	
	2. Line Color: select the color of polyline and curve, also the color of the polygon mesh generated in 3D mode
	3. Clear Color: select the background color.
	4. Rotating Axis: in 3D mode, selecting which axis the object is supposed to rotating about: X, Y, Z or MIX (rotating about 
	vector (1,1,1)).
	
Keys: 
	1. Press "ESC" key at anytime will terminate the program and exit
	2. Press "s" (lowercase) will switch between 2D and 3D mode, the application starts with 2D mode. 
	2. Only in 2D mode: Press "d"(lowercase) when dragging a vertex(using rubberbanding, see below) will delete the vertex.	
	4. Both in 2D and 3D mode: Press + will increase the bezier curve approximiation level by 1; press - will decrease
		the approximation level by 1; 	 

Rubberbanding: **Only in 2D mode**
	When rubberbanding is enabled (See Menu), clicking and dragging a point can adjust the position of 
	the point. When left mouse is up, the point is define. However, if mouse is up outside 
	the green box,  no point is defined. 

Select/Edit/Delete a vertex: **Only in 2D mode**
	Click close to any vertex will enable the vertex to be dragged. A reasonable neighborhood 
	is defined to enable easy pick-up. When picked up, a vertex can be dragged using mouse dragging
	action. 
	
	Edit its postion by releasing the left mouse at an appropriate position. A vertex cannot be dragged 
	out of the green box and released there, it must be released within the green box in order to make it count. 
	
	Press "d" key when dragging a vertex will result in deleting the picked-up vertex.If 
	there is only three vetices left, deleting any of the three vertices will make the polygon 
	disappear because there is only two vertices left which cannot make up a polygon.
